While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=american-folk-art-wallpaper--wallpaperup-natives--exactwall>American Folk Art Wallpaper : Wallpaperup Natives | Exactwall<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#american-folk-art-wallpaper--wallpaperup-natives--exactwall>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.wallpaperup.com/uploads/wallpapers/2016/05/07/945448/e83fbdc7b8b41b7ea108fbd5ba7636f9.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.6D-9x7i0G36hCPvVunY2-QEgDY&pid=15.1"' alt="American Folk Art Wallpaper : Wallpaperup Natives | exactwall"><p><em>Source: exactwall.github.io</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><ol><li>tangerine</li></ol><h2 id=afremov-original-oil-painting-palette-knife-impressionist>Afremov, Original, Oil, Painting, Palette Knife, Impressionist<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#afremov-original-oil-painting-palette-knife-impressionist>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://afremov.com/images/product/image_1470.jpeg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.95exPgZ94h2tyqueJoBqZQHaF9&pid=15.1"' alt="afremov, original, oil, painting, palette knife, impressionist"><p><em>Source: afremov.com</em></p><blockquote><p>oil afremov painting canvas fall leonid yellow paintings original palette knife impressionism city landscape impressionist paint wall buy colors.</p></blockquote><p>Anime wallpaper is a popular way to add some extra excitement to your home screen.
